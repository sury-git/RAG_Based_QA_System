The Last Judgment by painter Hans Memling. In Christian
belief, the Last Judgement is an apocalyptic event where
God makes a final judgement of all people on Earth.
List of dates predicted for apocalyptic events
Predictions of apocalyptic events that will
result in the extinction of humanity, a collapse
of civilization, or the destruction of the planet
have been made since at least the beginning of
the Common Era.[1] Most predictions are
related to Abrahamic religions, often standing
for or similar to the eschatological events
described in their scriptures. Christian
predictions typically refer to events like the
Rapture, Great Tribulation, Last Judgment,
and the Second Coming of Christ. End-time
events are normally predicted to occur within
the lifetime of the person making the
prediction and are usually made using the
Bible—in particular the New Testament—as
either the primary or exclusive source for the
predictions.[1] This often takes the form of mathematical calculations, such as trying to calculate the point
in time where it will have been 6,000 years since the supposed creation of the Earth by the Abrahamic
God
,
[2] which according to the Talmud marks the deadline for the Messiah to appear.[3] Predictions of the
end from natural events have also been theorised by various scientists and scientific groups. While these
predictions are generally accepted as plausible within the scientific community, the events and
phenomena are not expected to occur for hundreds of thousands, or even billions, of years from now.
Little research has been carried out into the reasons that people make apocalyptic predictions.[4]
Historically, such predictions have been made for the purpose of diverting attention from actual crises
like poverty and war, pushing political agendas, or promoting hatred of certain groups; antisemitism was
a popular theme of Christian apocalyptic predictions in medieval times,[5] while French and Lutheran
depictions of the apocalypse were known to feature English and Catholic antagonists, respectively.[6]
According to psychologists, possible explanations for why people believe in modern apocalyptic
predictions include: mentally reducing the actual danger in the world to a single and definable source; an
innate human fascination with fear; personality traits of paranoia and powerlessness; and a modern
romanticism related to end-times, resulting from its portrayal in contemporary fiction.[4][7] The
prevalence of Abrahamic religions throughout modern history is said to have created a culture that
encourages the embracement of a future drastically different from the present.[1][8] Such a culture is
credited for the rise in popularity of predictions that are more secular in nature, such as the 2012
phenomenon, while maintaining the centuries-old theme that a powerful force will bring about the end of
humanity.[8]
In 2012, opinion polls conducted across 20 countries found that over 14% of people believe the world
will end in their lifetime, with percentages ranging from 6% of people in France to 22% in the United
States and Turkey. Belief in the apocalypse is most prevalent in people with lower levels of education,lower household incomes, and those under the age of 35.[9][10] In the United Kingdom in 2015, 23% of
the general public believed the apocalypse was likely to occur in their lifetime, compared to 10% of
experts from the Global Challenges Foundation. The general public believed the likeliest cause would be
nuclear war, while experts thought it would be artificial intelligence. Only 3% of Britons thought the end
would be caused by the Last Judgement, compared with 16% of Americans. Up to 3% of the people
surveyed in both the UK and the US thought the apocalypse would be caused by zombies or alien
invasion.[11][12][13]

In approximately 300,000 years, WR 104, a triple star, is expected to
explode in a supernova. It has been suggested that it may produce a
gamma ray burst that could pose a threat to life on Earth should its
poles be aligned 12° or lower towards Earth. However spectroscopic
observations now strongly suggest that it is tilted at an angle of
30°-40° and so any gamma ray burst should not hit Earth.

A hypothetical dark companion star, Nemesis, with an eccentric orbit
of about 27 million years, triggers periodic mass extinctions by
perturbing objects beyond Neptune into hitting the Earth. The K–Pg
extinction which killed dinosaurs 66 million years ago is used as an
anchor point in time for the cycle. Arguments against say it is a
statistical artifact and sky surveys have failed to find it.

that triggered the K–Pg extinction which killed dinosaurs 66 million
years ago.

By this time it is estimated that a gamma ray burst, or massive,
hyperenergetic supernova, would have occurred within 6,500 lightyears of Earth; close enough for its rays to affect Earth's ozone layer
and potentially trigger a mass extinction, assuming the hypothesis is
correct that a previous such explosion triggered the Ordovician–
Silurian extinction event. However, the supernova would have to be
precisely oriented relative to Earth to have any negative effect.
