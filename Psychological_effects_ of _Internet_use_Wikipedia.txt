Psychological effects of Internet use
Various researchers have undertaken efforts to examine the psychological effects of Internet use.
Some research employs studying brain functions in Internet users. Some studies assert that these
changes are harmful, while others argue that asserted changes are beneficial.[1]
American writer Nicholas Carr asserts that Internet use reduces the deep thinking that leads to true
creativity. He also says that hyperlinks and overstimulation means that the brain must give most of
its attention to short-term decisions. Carr also states that the vast availability of information on the
World Wide Web overwhelms the brain and hurts long-term memory. He says that the availability of
stimuli leads to a very large cognitive load, which makes it difficult to remember anything.[2][3]
In a recent study[4] involving millions
of users watching online videos, users
with faster Internet connectivity (e.g.,
fiber) abandoned a slow-loading video
at a faster rate than similar users with
slower Internet connectivity (e.g.,
cable or mobile). Commentators have
argued that the Sitaraman study
shows that when humans get
accustomed to a faster flow of
information on the Internet, they
become more impatient and have less
tolerance for delays.[5][6]
Computer scientist Ramesh Sitaraman has asserted that Internet users are impatient and are likely
to get more impatient with time.[7] In a large-scale research study[4][8] that completed in 2012
involving millions of users watching videos on the Internet, Krishnan and Sitaraman show that users
start to abandon online videos if they do not start playing within two seconds.[9] In addition, users
Assertionswith faster Internet connections (such as FTTH) showed less patience and abandoned videos at a
faster rate than users with slower Internet connections. Many commentators have since argued that
these results provide a glimpse into the future: as Internet services become faster and provide more
instant gratification, people become less patient[5][6] and less able to delay gratification and work
towards longer-term rewards.[10]
Psychologist Steven Pinker, however, argues that people have control over what they do, and that
research and reasoning never came naturally to people. He says that "experience does not revamp
the basic information-processing capacities of the brain" and asserts that the Internet is actually
making people smarter.[11]
The BBC describes the research published in the peer-reviewed science journal PLoS ONE:
"A research team led by Hao Lei of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan carried out brain
scans of 35 men and women aged between 14 and 21. Seventeen of them were classed as
having Internet addiction disorder (IAD) on the basis of answering yes to questions such as,
"Have you repeatedly made unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back or stop Internet use?"[12]
Specialised MRI brain scans showed changes in the white matter of the brain—the part that
contains nerve fibres—in those classed as being web addicts, compared with non-addicts.
Furthermore, the study says, "We provided evidences demonstrating the multiple structural changes
of the brain in IAD subjects. VBM results indicated the decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC), the cerebellum and the left rostral ACC (rACC)."[13]
UCLA professor of psychiatry Gary Small studied brain activity in experienced web surfers versus
casual web surfers. He used MRI scans on both groups to evaluate brain activity. The study showed
that when Internet surfing, the brain activity of the experienced Internet users was far more
extensive than that of the novices, particularly in areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with
problem-solving and decision making. However, the two groups had no significant differences in
brain activity when reading blocks of text. This evidence suggested that the distinctive neural
pathways of experienced Web users had developed because of their Web use. Dr. Small concluded
that "The current explosion of digital technology not only is changing the way we live and
communicate, but is rapidly and profoundly altering our brains."[14]
MRI studiesEffect on traditional reading
In an August 2008 article in The Atlantic ("Is Google Making Us Stupid?"), Nicholas Carr
experientially asserts that using the Internet can lead to lower attention span and make it more
difficult to read in the traditional sense (that is, read a book at length without mental interruptions).
He says that he and his friends have found it more difficult to concentrate and read whole books,
even though they read a great deal when they were younger (that is, when they did not have access
to the Internet).[15] This assertion is based on anecdotal evidence, not controlled research.
Researchers from the University College London have done a 5-year study on Internet habits, and
have found that people using the sites exhibited "a form of skimming activity," hopping from one
source to another and rarely returning to any source they'd already visited. The 2008 report says, "It
is clear that users are not reading online in the traditional sense; indeed there are signs that new
forms of "reading" are emerging as users "power browse" horizontally through titles, contents pages
and abstracts going for quick wins. It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the
traditional sense."[16]
Research suggests that using the Internet helps boost brain power for middle-aged and older
people[17] (research on younger people has not been done). The study compares brain activity when
the subjects were reading and when the subjects were surfing the Internet. It found that Internet
surfing uses much more brain activity than reading does. Lead researcher Professor Gary Small
said: "The study results are encouraging, that emerging computerized technologies may have
physiological effects and potential benefits for middle-aged and older adults.[18] Internet searching
engages complicated brain activity, which may help exercise and improve brain function."[19]
One of the most widely debated effects of social networking has been its influence on productivity.
In many schools and workplaces, social media sites are blocked because employers believe their
employees will be distracted and unfocused on the sites. It seems, at least from one study, that
employers do, indeed, have reason to be concerned. A survey from Hearst Communications found
that productivity levels of people that used social networking sites were 1.5% lower than those that
did not.[20] Logically, people cannot get work done when they are performing other tasks. If the
employees suffer from degrading self-control, it will be even harder for them to get back to work and
maintain productivity.
Brain power
ProductivityEvgeny Morozov has said that social networking could be potentially harmful to people. He writes
that they can destroy privacy, and notes that "Insurance companies have accessed their patients'
Facebook accounts to try to disprove they have hard-to-verify health problems like depression;
employers have checked social networking sites to vet future employees; university authorities have
searched the web for photos of their students' drinking or smoking pot." He also said that the
Internet also makes people more complacent and risk averse. He said that because much of the
ubiquity of modern technology—cameras, recorders, and such—people may not want to act in
unusual ways for fear of getting a bad name. People can see pictures and videos of you on the
Internet, and this may make you act differently.[21]
According to the New York Times, many scientists say that "people's ability to focus is being
undermined by bursts of information".[22]
From 53,573 page views taken from various users, 17% of the views lasted less than 4 seconds
while 4% lasted more than 10 minutes. In regards to page content, users will only read 49% of a site
that contains 111 words or fewer while users will opt to read 28% of an average website
(approximately 593 words). For each additional 100 words on a site, users will spend 4.4 seconds
longer on the site.[23]
It is found that those who read articles online go through the article more thoroughly than those
who read from print-based materials. Upon choosing their reading material, online readers read 77%
of the content, which can be compared to broadsheet newspaper where the corresponding number
is 62%.[24]
Interacting on the Internet mostly does not involve "physical" interactions with another person (i.e.
face-to-face conversation), and therefore easily leads to a person feeling free to act differently
online, as well as unrestraint in civility and minimization of authority, etc.
People who are socially anxious are more likely to use electronic communication as their only
means of communication. This, in turn, makes them more likely to disclose personal information to
strangers online that they normally wouldn't give out face-to-face.[25] The phenomenon is a likely
Effects of social networking and behavior
Attention span
Effects of anonymitycause for the prevalence of cyberbullying, especially for children who do not understand "social
networking etiquette."
Internet anonymity can lead to online disinhibition, in which people do and say things online that
they normally wouldn't do or say in person. Psychology researcher John Suler differentiates
between benign disinhibition in which people can grow psychologically by revealing secret emotions,
fears, and wishes and showing unusual acts of kindness and generosity and toxic disinhibition, in
which people use rude language, harsh criticisms, anger, hatred and threats or visit pornographic or
violent sites that they wouldn't in the 'real world.'[26]
People become addicted or dependent on the Internet through excessive computer use that
interferes with daily life. Kimberly S. Young[27] links internet addiction disorder with existing mental
health issues, most commonly depression. Young states that the disorder has significant effects
socially, psychologically and occupationally.
"Aric Sigman's presentation to members of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health
outlined the parallels between screen dependency and alcohol and drug addiction: the instant
stimulation provided by all those flickering graphics leads to the release of dopamine, a chemical
that's central to the brain's reward system".[28]
A 2009 study suggested that brain structural changes were present in those classified by the
researchers as Internet addicted, similar to those classified as chemically addicted.[29]
In one study, the researchers selected seventeen subjects with online gaming addiction and another
seventeen naive internet users who rarely used the internet. Using a magnetic resonance imaging
scanner, they performed a scan to "acquire 3-dimensional T1-weighted images" of the subject's
brain. The results of the scan revealed that online gaming addiction "impairs gray and white matter
integrity in the orbitofrontal cortex of the prefrontal regions of the brain".[30] According to Keath Low,
psychotherapist, the orbitofrontal cortex "has a major impact on our ability to perform such tasks as
planning, prioritizing, paying attention to and remembering details, and controlling our attention".[31]
As a result, Keith Low believes that these online gaming addicts are incapable of prioritizing their
life or setting a goal and accomplishing it because of the impairment of their orbitofrontal cortex.
Internet addictionEase of access to the Internet can increase escapism in which a user uses the Internet as an
"escape" from the perceived unpleasant or banal aspects of daily/real life.[32] Because the internet
and virtual realities easily satisfy social needs and drives, according to Jim Blascovich and Jeremy
Bailensen, "sometimes [they are] so satisfying that addicted users will withdraw physically from
society." Stanford psychiatrist Dr. Elias Aboujaoude believes that advances in virtual reality and
immersive 3-D have led us to "where we can have a 'full life' [online] that can be quite removed from
our own." Eventually, virtual reality may drastically change a person's social and emotional needs.
"We may stop 'needing' or craving real social interactions because they may become foreign to us,"
Aboujaoude says.[33]
Psychological distress has been found to influence and increase escapism. Escapism, in turn,
increases the likelihood of internet addiction, compulsive internet use, gaming addiction, and further
harmful consequences.[34] [35]
Internet has its impact on all age groups from elders to children. According to the article 'Digital
power: exploring the effects of social media on children's spirituality', children consider the Internet
as their third place after home and school.[36]
One of the main effects social media has had on children is the effect of cyber bullying. A study
carried out by 177 students in Canada found that "15% of the students admitted that they
cyberbullied others" while "40% of the cyber victims had no idea who the bullies were".[37] The
psychological harm cyber bullying can cause is reflected in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety.
It also opens up avenues for manipulation and control. Cyber bullying has ultimately led to
depression, anxiety and in severe cases suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for youth
between the ages of 10 and 24. Cyber bullying is rapidly increasing. Some writers have suggested
monitoring and educating children from a young age about the risks associated with cyber
bullying.[38]
Children use, on average, 27 hours of internet a week and it is on the increase. This leads to an
increased risk of insomnia.[39]
Screen time is affecting children in many ways, not only are children at an increased risk of
insomnia but they are also at risk of having eye and health developing problems. A study done in
2018 showed that young children are experiencing Computer Vision Syndrome, also referred to as
Escapism
Effects on childrenDigital Eye Strain symptoms which include blurred or double vision, headaches, eye fatigue, and
more. Many kids are having to wear glasses at a younger age due to excessive amount of
screentime. Health problems are also a big effect of the internet.[40] The National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health did a study on adolescents ranging from 7-12 grade and they found that more
screen time increases the risk of obesity. Reducing the amount of time children spend on the
internet can prevent getting diseases like obesity and diabetes.[41]
"A psychologist, Aric Sigman, warned of the perils of "passive parenting" and "benign neglect"
caused by parent's reliance on gadgets".[28] In some cases, parents' internet addictions can have
drastic effects on their children. In 2009, a three-year-old girl from New Mexico died of malnutrition
and dehydration on the same day that her mother was said to have spent 15 hours playing World of
Warcraft online.[33] In another case in 2014, a Korean couple became so immersed in a video game
that allowed them to raise a virtual child online that they let their real baby die.[42] The effects of the
Internet on parenting can be observed in a how parents utilize the Internet, the response to their
child's Internet consumption, as well as the effects and influences that the Internet has on the
relationship between parent and child.
Parental Internet use and opinions towards family impact
Overall, parents are seen to do simple tasks such as sending e-mails and keep up with current
events whereas social networking sites are less frequented. In regards to researching parental
material, a study conducted in January 2012 by the University of Minnesota found that 75% of
questioned parents have stated that the Internet improves their method of obtaining parenting
related information, 19.7% found parenting websites too complex to navigate, and 13.1% of the
group did not find any useful parenting information on any website.[43]
Many studies have shown that parents view the Internet as a hub of information especially in their
children's education.[44] They feel that it is a valuable commodity that can enhance their learning
experience and when used in this manner it does not contribute to any family tension or conflicts.
However, when the Internet is used as a social medium (either online gaming or social networking
sites) there is a positive correlation between the use of the Internet and family conflicts. In
conjunction with using the Internet for social means, there is a risk of exposing familial information
to strangers, which is perceived to parents as a threat and can ultimately weaken family boundaries.
Effects on parentingParental response to child online consumption
A report released in October 2012 by Ofcom focused on the amount of online consumption done by
children aged 5–15 and how the parents react to their child's consumption. Of the parents
interviewed, 85% use a form of online mediation ranging from face-to-face talks with their children
about online surfing to cellphone browser filters. The remaining 15% of parents do not take active
measures to adequately inform their children of safe Internet browsing; these parents have either
spoken only briefly to their children about cautious surfing or do not do anything at all.
Parents are active in monitoring their child's online use by using methods such as investigating the
browsing history and by regulating Internet usage. However, since parents are less versed in Internet
usage than their children they are more concerned with the Internet interfering with family life than
online matters such as child grooming or cyber-bullying.
When addressing those with lack of parental control over the Internet, parents state that their child
is rarely alone (defined for children from 5–11 years old) or that they trust their children when they
are online (for children 12–15 years old). Approximately 80% of parents ensure that their child has
been taught Internet safety from school and 70% of parents feel that the benefits of using the
Internet are greater than the risks that come along with it.[45]
Conversely an American study, conducted by PewInternet released on 20 November 2012, reveal
that parents are highly concerned about the problems the Internet can impose on their teenage
children. 47% of parents are tend to worry about their children being exposed to inappropriate
material on the Internet and 45% of the parents are concerned about their children's behaviour
towards each other both online offline. Only 31% of parents showed concern about the Internet
taking away social time from the family.[46]
Effects of Internet use on parent-child relationships
Researcher Sanford Grossbart and others explores the relationship between the mother and child
and how Internet use affects this relationship. This study forms its basis around Marvin Sussman
and Suzanne Steinmetz's idea that the relationship between parent and child is highly influenced by
the changing experiences and events of each generation.[47] "Parental warmth" is a factor in how
receptive a parent is to being taught the nuances of the Internet by their child versus the traditional
method of the parent influencing the child. If the parent displayed "warm" tendencies she was more
open to learning how to use the Internet from their child even if the parent happened to be more
knowledgeable on the subject. This fosters teaching in a positive environment, which sustains astrong relationship between mother and child, encourages education, and promotes mature
behaviour. "Cooler" mothers only allowed themselves to be taught if they thought that their child
held the same amount of knowledge or greater and would dismiss the teaching otherwise
suggesting a relationship that stems from the majority of influence coming from the parent.[48]
However, despite warm and cool parenting methods, parents who encounter a language barrier rely
more heavily on their children to utilize the Internet. Vikki Katz of Rutgers University has studied the
interaction between immigrant parents and children and how they use technology. Katz notes that
the majority resources that immigrants find helpful are located online, however the search
algorithms currently in place do not direct languages other than English appropriately. Because of
this shortcoming, parents strongly encourage their bilingual children to bridge the gap between the
Internet and language.[49]
The Internet is increasingly being used as a virtual babysitter when parents actively download
applications specifically for their children with intentions to keep them calm. A survey conducted by
Ipsos has found that half of the interviewed parents believe children ages 8–13 are old enough to
own or carry smartphones thus increasing online content consumption in younger generations.
